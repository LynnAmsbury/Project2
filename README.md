# Welcome to The Great Stress Escape! 
https://thegreatstressescape.herokuapp.com/

We created this web page to give people break when when he or she can not get away from their computer. Like any web page, you can spend as much time on it as you would like. However, we intended most of our users to spend just a few minutes, if not less on this page. 

# Calming Images
Clicking the “Calm” button will display randomly generated, relaxing images. These images have been submitted by the creators of this web page. They call themselves the Fabulous Five.
