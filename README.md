# Welcome to The Great Stress Escape!

The Great Stress Escape is a full-stack application that provides content intended for immediate relief of stress when users are frustrated but cannot leave the situation that they are in. Users click on buttons to receive calming images, inspirational quotes, or soothing sounds. Users may also enter their own inspirational quote if desired once out of the stressful situation. The the anti-stress modalities may be used in combination with each other and for as long as desired, although the intent is to provide quick, rapid relief in a few moments.

## Sample User Stories:

As a user, I am stuck in this meeting where the boss has been chewing me out in front of the whole team for about 30 minutes. I am about to lose it, but if I get up and leave I'll get fired. Fortunately I have my computer open and my boss will never know that I'm looking at pictures of beautiful scenery to calm myself down.

As a user, I am a parent who has both a screeching infant and a toddler throwing a tantrum. I can't leave them alone - what kind of parent would I be - but I cannot listen to this for one more second without going crazy. I'm going to get a few inspirational quotes and listen to some soothing music - turned up loud so I can hear it over the kids' ruckus! Maybe it will calm them down too - it doesn't hurt to hope!
